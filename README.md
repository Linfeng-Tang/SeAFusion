## To Train

Run ```**CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python train.py**``` to train your model.
The training data are selected from the MFNet dataset. For convenient training, users can download the training dataset from [here](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1xueuKYvYp7uPObzvywdgyA), in which the extraction code is: **bvfl**.

The MFNet dataset can be downloaded via the following link: [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18BQFWRfhXzSuMloUmtiBRFrr6NSrf8Fw](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18BQFWRfhXzSuMloUmtiBRFrr6NSrf8Fw).
